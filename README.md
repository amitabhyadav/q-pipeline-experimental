# q-pipeline-experimental
Project Code Name: anne-hathaway


__The use case is to test an experimental Quantum/Classical Instrustion Set Architecture by developing a quantum pipeline and queue manager for issuing quantum operations with timing precision. Contains two FIFO units. Operations are triggered from the Queue Manager.__
